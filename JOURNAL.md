## Day 1 - May 6
Brainstorming what parts to use:
- Engine: either a cheap aliexpress engine, or a predator 212 if budget allows
- Motors: either cheap hoverboard motors, or a good one like an my1020

(The more expensive ones would obviously be better, but I'll see how much everything ends up costing in the end)
- Metal will likely be random scrap metal I have around, or some from metal recycling. Not too sure where to get metal.
- Wheels are pretty good and cheap at harbor freight
-   Or can possibly use the hoverboard wheels
- Not sure where to get parts for steering mechanism

I've created a rough model of the go kart:

I tried to keep it simple while still keeping it professional.<br>
And I kind of kept adding stuff to it as I made it. At first it was just a super basic frame. Then I turned it into a truck. Then when doing the steering wheel I added the elevated beams on both sides. The result turned out pretty cool.

## Day 2 - May 7
Today was focused on figuring out what parts to use and creating the BOM. I had a rough idea when designing the CAD model, but only for things like the wheels, engine, and motors. For smaller stuff I had to spend quite a while thinking about it.<br>
A few notable parts:
- **Steering wheel and seat:** I tried look for cheap parts for both of these but all of them ended up way too expensive. Nobody is paying $30 for a plastic steering wheel. I opted to 3D print the steering wheel myself and buy a plastic folding chair for the seat. Folding chair is a little rough, cause I'm gonna have to cut the legs off to make it actually fit well.
- **Sprocket and chain:** This was probably the hardest parts to find. Since the engine is this cheap chinese one from aliexpress, it needed a specific type of sprocket that would still fit on our rear axle. For this itself, it probably took around an hour to find.
- **Motor controller:** Finding a good motor controller was harder than expected. I was planning to use one of those box ones with wires sticking out, but after getting feedback from soneone in the Hack Club slack, I found out about BLDC controllers which I ended up using.
- **Bearings:** The tough part about bearings is that I needed a specific inner diameter *and* outer diameter. It was easy to find one or the other, but not both. The only place I was able to find both was on a specific site for bearings, but it was $5 for each one. I don't think Highway would like that very much so i opted for some cheap bearings on Amazon that arent the exact size, but close enough.

The total price of the kart ended up at just over $300. It's a little more than I was expecting, but it is lower than the $350 at least. That's if I can even get this accepted as a 10 point project...<br>

I also spent some time refining the CAD model. The previous version was the right design but wrong proportion. It was far too big, so I shrunk it down. I also found that in the shrunken down version, it was only about 2 ft wide, so I ended up also having to make it wider and also make it a little longer. A couple more changes too, like the sprocket and chain, steering wheel model, and wheels.
