## Total Time Spent: ~15 Hours
# Journal

## Day 1 - May 6
Brainstorming what parts to use:
- Engine: either a cheap aliexpress engine, or a predator 212 if budget allows
- Motors: either cheap hoverboard motors, or a good one like an my1020

(The more expensive ones would obviously be better, but I'll see how much everything ends up costing in the end)
- Metal will likely be random scrap metal I have around, or some from metal recycling. Not too sure where to get metal.
- Wheels are pretty good and cheap at harbor freight
-   Or can possibly use the hoverboard wheels
- Not sure where to get parts for steering mechanism

I've created a rough model of the go kart:

I tried to keep it simple while still keeping it professional.<br>
And I kind of kept adding stuff to it as I made it. At first it was just a super basic frame. Then I turned it into a truck. Then when doing the steering wheel I added the elevated beams on both sides. The result turned out pretty cool.

## Day 2 - May 7
Today was focused on figuring out what parts to use and creating the BOM. I had a rough idea when designing the CAD model, but only for things like the wheels, engine, and motors. For smaller stuff I had to spend quite a while thinking about it.<br>
A few notable parts:
- **Steering wheel and seat:** I tried look for cheap parts for both of these but all of them ended up way too expensive. Nobody is paying $30 for a plastic steering wheel. I opted to 3D print the steering wheel myself and buy a plastic folding chair for the seat. Folding chair is a little rough, cause I'm gonna have to cut the legs off to make it actually fit well.
- **Sprocket and chain:** This was probably the hardest parts to find. Since the engine is this cheap chinese one from aliexpress, it needed a specific type of sprocket that would still fit on our rear axle. For this itself, it probably took around an hour to find.
- **Motor controller:** Finding a good motor controller was harder than expected. I was planning to use one of those box ones with wires sticking out, but after getting feedback from soneone in the Hack Club slack, I found out about BLDC controllers which I ended up using.
- **Bearings:** The tough part about bearings is that I needed a specific inner diameter *and* outer diameter. It was easy to find one or the other, but not both. The only place I was able to find both was on a specific site for bearings, but it was $5 for each one. I don't think Highway would like that very much so i opted for some cheap bearings on Amazon that arent the exact size, but close enough.

The total price of the kart ended up at just over $300. It's a little more than I was expecting, but it is lower than the $350 at least. That's if I can even get this accepted as a 10 point project...<br>

I also spent some time refining the CAD model. The previous version was the right design but wrong proportion. It was far too big, so I shrunk it down. I also found that in the shrunken down version, it was only about 2 ft wide, so I ended up also having to make it wider and also make it a little longer. A couple more changes too, like the sprocket and chain, steering wheel model, and wheels.

### Total Session Time: 6 Hours

## Day 3 - May 8
Since the CAD model and BOM are pretty much done, I spent today refining both of those, as well as looking for some parts to buy.<br>
### CAD Changes
Originally I was planning to build the seat of the go kart from scratch out of wood, but decided it would only cost a little more to just get a standard foldable chair. Although I already decided this yesterday, I didn't update the CAD model accordingly, so I found a chair 3d model, stuck it on the car model, and chopped its legs off to where its much closer to the ground

### BOM Changes
After double checking each of the links on the BOM, it turns out the hole saw kit didn't have a 1-3/8" saw, which we definitely needed. I had to look for a different one that did have it, and this new one has many more sizes but it's like $10 more. Hopefully Hack Club won't mind, because I kind of need them and buying them individually would feel like a waste.<br>
I also added a throttle to the BOM that I will use to control the hoverboard motors.
### Finding Parts
I'm guessing we're supposed to wait for the grant before buying any parts, but I'm going to buy some now and hopefully get it reimbursed later. First I wanted to get the two metal rods I need, one for the rear axle, and one for the steering. I picked up the steering axle at a Home Depot, but they didn't have the axle rod I needed. So I ended up having to go to a different much larger home depot to get it. I also looked for hole saws at both but they are way too expensive. I also picked up some washers that I'll need.

Oh yeah, and I finished most of the README file. Should be able to submit this whole project soon üëç
