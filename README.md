# The Hybrid Truck Kart
A custom hybrid truck-style go-kart with a 49cc 2-stroke engine, a cargo bed, and 400w 36v hoverboard motors and batteries, all on a custom built frame.

## Why?
I've dreamed of building a go-kart for a while now, but the high cost of parts always held me back. This project is my first step to building my end-goal project: a full sized hybrid vehicle. It's sort of like a practice demo for making vehicles, while still making something cool that I can drive around in. <br/> *But why a truck?* To carry around my treasure!

## Technical Overview
This go-kart is a hybrid system:
- **Powertrain**: A 49cc 2-stroke 3hp engine drives the rear axle via a 14T/54T sprocket setup, with two salvaged hoverboard motors on the front wheels providing acceleration, controlled by 400W BLDC controllers.
- **Frame**: Custom made with salvaged steel tubes, cut to the right lengths. using steel rods as axles
- **Electronics**: Repurposed hoverboard batteries and 400w 36v motors, integrating them into this go-kart instead.
- **Challenges**: Hybrid powertrain, frame stability with heavy loads, and designing a steering system.
